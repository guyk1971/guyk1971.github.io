# My Knowledgebase

## Math and Statistics 
theories and practices in math and stats

## Machine Learning Foundations
Foundational Methods and techniques in Machine learning that can be applied to any applicative domain.  
For example:
- Reinforcement Learning
- Semi Spervised Learning
- Representation Learning
- Causality
- Self Supervised Learning
- Continual Learning
- Common techniques in deep learning (neural nets)
- Graph theories
- Probabilistic Graphical models
- Foundational sequence models
    - RNN
    - Transformers
    - SSM

## Application domains
AI/ML techniques and foundation models that are strongly related to specific domains.  
The domains are:
- NLP
- Computer Vision
- AI OPS
- Recommender systems
- Audio and Speech
- Control (e.g. PID)

Question: where do I put foundational backbones that can serve variosu domains ?
- Transformers
- State Space Models 
they are both related to sequence modeling which can be applied to any of the app domains. so they are common.
